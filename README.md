# @adaliszk/qwik-material-ui

Sandbox project that implements the 3rd version of Material Design for Qwik. The goal for me with this is to learn
both Qwik and React ecosystem and best practices. In general, I would like to apply my knowledge coming from lit-based
web component world and create a lightweight library that exposes the theming options via CSS properties.

For a more serious project, please check out https://github.com/qwikifiers/qwik-ui!

## Prerequisites

- Node
- Yarn

## Quick Start

```bash
yarn install && yarn start
```

# Contributions

While this is a sandbox project for now, you are free to use it and contribute to it!  
I would especially welcome reviews and guidance on the practices.
