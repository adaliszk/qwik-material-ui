# @adaliszk/qwik-material-components

Implements the 3rd version of Material Design for Qwik with Builder.io support. The goal is to provide a lightweight
solution and expose enough CSS properties to customize the experience.

## Usage

1. Add the package types with yarn or npm:
    ```bash
      yarn add @adaliszk/qwik-material-ui
    ```
2. Use the Components within our Qwik application
    ```typescript jsx
      import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik'
      import { Button } from '@adaliszk/qwik-material-ui'

      export default component$(() => {
        return (
            <Button theme={'filled'}>Star this project</Button>
        )
      })
    ```
